# Project Title
Weather App (Python + GUI) - Early Version
# Description
The Weather App is a program developed in Python which gets weather information from **OpenWeatherMaps** and then displays it on a easy-to-read GUI.
While the program obtains real-time weather data, it only gets it from an specific location. This is an early version of the project.
# Dependencies
- Libraries:
   - Tkinter
   - PIL
   - datetime
   - request
   - pytz
- **! IMPORTANT !** This program requires an API key which can be obtain by visiting -> https://openweathermap.org/api
# Features
- Extract real-time weather data including temperature, pressure, wind speed, condition, and humidity
- Shows current time on the specific location
- Simple GUI which will display weather data and icons according to the current condition. (e.g, if sunny, there's going to be a sun icon showing up)
- API verification which will help you valid your API key. (If not, the program can't access weather data)
# TO-DO / UPCOMING FEATURES
This current version of the project is an early stage and bugs/errors can be expected. However, there is an ongoing development to improve many parts of the code
to include features, a nicer GUI, cleaner code, and much more. Each new version will have it's own post which will contain all changes performed in the version.

With nothing more to say, let me enlight you with some planned features coming next version:
- Improve GUI (colors, elements, fonts, etc)
- Implement following weather details:
   - Highest and Lowest temperature
   - Air Quality
   - Precipitation
   - Visibility
- Provide an API key for public use (In other words, remove the dependency of having a API key, so non-developers can use the program)
- Develop a search tool to get accurate weather data and time zone from any country
- Optimize code


I hope you enjoy using my Weather App and remember that any feedback is greatly appreciate it :)!
