# Weather App (Python + GUI + Weather Data Retrieval) v3.0

## Description

The Weather App is a Python program that retrieves weather information from OpenWeatherMap and displays it in an easy-to-read graphical user interface (GUI). Currently, the app fetches real-time weather data for a specific location, which can be customized in the source code.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is no longer actively maintained, as I am shifting my focus towards web development and quality assurance (QA). However, the app remains fully functional and available for use or reference.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter  
- PIL (Pillow)  
- datetime  
- requests  

> **Important:** The OpenWeatherMap API used here has request limits. It's recommended to get your own free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).


## Features

- Retrieves real-time weather data, including temperature, pressure, wind speed, condition, and humidity  
- Displays custom alerts and advice based on weather conditions (Note: These alerts are user-created, not official warnings from National Weather Services)  
- Simple GUI showing weather data with condition-specific icons  
- Automatic API verification and testing  
- Log file for debugging with warnings, issues, and useful information  

## Planned Features (When the Project Was Active)

*Note: Since active development has ceased, these features remain ideas for future implementation:*

- Search tool to retrieve weather data for any location worldwide  
- Improved, more user-friendly GUI  
- Weather predictions and forecasts  

> **Note:** There is a SLIGHT chance that these features are developed and deployed as a massive, but final build. However, contributions are encouraged :D!

## Maintenance & Updates

While this project was under active development, updates included bug fixes, cleaner code, and GUI improvements. As mentioned, I am no longer updating this repository regularly due to my focus shift toward web development and QA.  

## Feedback

Thank you for using the Weather App!  
Any feedback or contributions are still appreciated and welcome.
