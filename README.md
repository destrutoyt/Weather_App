# Project Title
Weather App (Python + GUI + Weather Data Retrieval) v3.0
# Description
The Weather App is a program developed in Python that gets weather information from **OpenWeatherMaps** and then displays it on an easy-to-read GUI.
While the program obtains real-time weather data, it only gets it from a specific location (Customizable in source code).
# Dependencies
- Libraries:
   - Tkinter
   - PIL
   - datetime
   - request
- **! IMPORTANT !** The API being used has limited uses and it is better to get one for free on OpenWeatherMap
# Features
- Extract real-time weather data including temperature, pressure, wind speed, condition, and humidity
- Displays custom alerts/advice depending on weather conditions. (NOTE: These alerts are custom-made and not officially an alert from the National Weather Services)
- A simple GUI that displays weather data and icons according to the current condition.
- Auto API Verification / Testing
- Log text file that includes any issues, warnings, or useful information for debugging purposes
# TO-DO / UPCOMING FEATURES
This project is still under development, and it will be updated often to accomplish its objectives. Every update will ALWAYS include:
- Bug fixes (Including grammar, logic, GUI elements, etc)
- Cleaner source code
- GUI design improvements

As for new features planned, this is what is going to be developed in the upcoming days (Ascending items are a priority):

1. A search tool that can be used to retrieve data from ANYWHERE in the world
2. New and improved GUI for easier view
3. Weather predictions
4. Conversion to an actual APP (Windows Only for now) - Possible final version


I hope you enjoy using my Weather App and remember that any feedback is greatly appreciated :)!
